#### NOTES:

- ### You won't have access to the dashboards/workbooks linked in the code!
  - **I am unable to to grant additional access at this time**
  - You'll need to update the urls, menus, etc. if you intend to use any of this code for your project
- **Don't open the .html files directly - they must be served over http to function properly!**
  - VS Code Extension: _Live Server_ - allows right-click > serve locally
- Expect CSS/DOM mistakes:
  - You'll notice bootstrap framework is imported, used mostly for CSS shortcuts/flexbox
  - In general, I avoided using any framework specific elements, components, css, etc. to avoid clutter or ambiguity
